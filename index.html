To combine the CSS and JavaScript into the `index.html` file, you can include the CSS within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section and the JavaScript within a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag. Hereâ€™s how the updated `index.html` file will look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Facts About Earth</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f0f8ff;
            color: #333;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 20px;
        }

        .container {
            max-width: 800px;
            margin: auto;
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 8px;
            background-color: #fff;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        }

        h1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: #2c3e50;
        }

        .fact {
            margin: 15px 0;
            padding: 10px;
            border: 1px solid #2c3e50;
            border-radius: 5px;
            background-color: #ecf0f1;
        }

### Instructions to Run the Combined Application

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside that directory, create a single file named `index.html`.
3. Copy and paste the above code into the `index.html` file.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

This will display the facts about Earth with the CSS and JavaScript included directly in the HTML file.
